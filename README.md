In building my app, I used the following components:
**FlatList:**
Displays efficient, vertically scrolling lists of data. Ideal for large datasets like chat history, product listings, or social media feeds.
Renders only visible items for performance optimization.
Requires providing data and a way to render each item (renderItem prop).

**Image:**
Displays images within your app.
Specify the image source using either a local file path or a remote URL (source prop).
Customize image dimensions, styles (like border radius), and resize behavior (resizeMode prop).

**SafeAreaView:**
Ensures your app's content renders safely within the viewport, avoiding overlapping with status bars or navigation bars.
Useful for building layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and device notches.

**StyleSheet:**
A central location to define reusable styles for your app's UI components (Views, Texts, etc.).
Styles are created using JavaScript objects with properties like backgroundColor, fontSize, or padding.
Reference these styles using the style prop on your components.

**Text:**
Displays textual content within your app.
Customize text properties like font size, color, weight, and alignment (style prop).

**View:**
The fundamental building block for app UIs. Represents a container for other components and defines layout.
Can be nested to create complex layouts.
Style the appearance of the View using the style prop (e.g., background color, margins).
